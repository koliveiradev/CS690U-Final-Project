# CS690U-Final-Project

MIBiG was one of the few tasks in the DGEB benchmark where increasing model size failed to create any significant increase in performance. This project aims to investigate ML classification models other than KNN to see whether they better utilize the embeddings of larger models and perform better than the default KNN model. KMeans Clustering is also performed on the data to investigate trends in how these models are classifying the embeddings to identify areas of improvement.
